## The New Paradigm: Customer Base View
In traditional marketing, the focus was often **Product-Centric**: build a product and then find customers for it. Modern marketing intelligence requires a shift to the **Customer Base View**.

This paradigm recognizes that the customer is the only source of cash flow. Instead of managing products, we manage **Customer Equity**—the total combined lifetime values of all the company's customers.

## Target Profiling & Segmentation
Segmentation is the process of dividing a broad consumer or business market into sub-groups of consumers based on some type of shared characteristics.

1.  **Demographics**: Age, gender, income, education.
2.  **Psychographics**: Values, personality, interests, lifestyle.
3.  **Behavioral**: Purchase history, brand loyalty, usage rate.
4.  **Needs-based**: Specific problems the customer is trying to solve.

## The Importance of Data in the Digital Era
Data is the "new oil" of marketing. However, raw data is useless without **interpretation**. 

Digital platforms provide us with massive amounts of behavioral data, but AI (specifically Large Language Models) allows us to bridge the gap between quantitative data and qualitative insights. By using AI to generate **Buyer Personas**, we can create a human-centric representation of our data segments, making them actionable for creative and strategic teams.

### Why Local AI?
Running AI models locally (via WebGPU) ensures:
- **Privacy**: Customer data never leaves the browser.
- **Latency**: No network round-trips for inference.
- **Cost**: No API fees per generation.
