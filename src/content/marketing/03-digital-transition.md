# Module 3: Digital Transition & Unit Economics

In the digital era, business success is no longer just about having a great product; it's about the math behind the customer journey. This module explores how digital tools have reshaped consumer behavior and why understanding **Unit Economics** is critical for any technology-driven enterprise.

## 1. The Digital Shift in Consumer Behavior
Digital tools have granted consumers unprecedented power:
- **Information Symmetry:** Instant price and quality comparisons.
- **Zero Friction:** One-click purchases and immediate gratification.
- **Social Proof:** Peer reviews often outweigh traditional advertising.

## 2. Omnichannel Strategy
The modern brand experience is "unified." An omnichannel approach ensures that whether a customer interacts via a mobile app, social media, or a physical store, the brand voice, data, and service remain consistent.
- **Key Metric:** Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) increases when customers engage across multiple channels.

## 3. Business Models: SaaS vs. E-commerce
Digital business models generally fall into two categories:
- **Subscription (SaaS):** High upfront CAC, but recurring revenue (ARPU) leads to long-term stability. Churn rate is the "silent killer."
- **Transactional (E-commerce):** Focus on high margins and repeat purchases. 

> *"E-commerce is not for everyone. If your CAC is higher than your margin, you are buying growth with debt."*

## 4. The Core Equation of Sustainability
A digital business is sustainable if:
1. **LTV / CAC > 3:** You earn at least 3x what you spend to get a customer.
2. **Payback Period < 12 months:** You recover your marketing spend in less than a year.
3. **Retention > Churn:** You keep customers longer than you lose them.
